### 1. Install TensorFlow-GPU 1.5 (skip this step if TensorFlow-GPU 1.5 is already installed)
Dependencies
Tensorflow Object Detection API depends on the following libraries:

Protobuf 3.0.0
Python-tk
Pillow 1.0
lxml
tf Slim (which is included in the "tensorflow/models/research/" checkout)
Jupyter notebook
Matplotlib
Tensorflow
Cython
contextlib2
cocoapi
For detailed steps to install Tensorflow, follow the Tensorflow installation instructions. A typical user can install Tensorflow using one of the following commands:

# For CPU
pip install tensorflow
# For GPU
pip install tensorflow-gpu
The remaining libraries can be installed on Ubuntu 16.04 using via apt-get:
```
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler python-pil python-lxml python-tk
pip3 install --user Cython
pip3 install --user contextlib2
pip3 install --user jupyter
pip3 install --user matplotlib
Alternatively, users can install dependencies using pip:

pip3 install --user Cython
pip3 install --user contextlib2
pip3 install --user pillow
pip3 install --user lxml
pip3 install --user jupyter
pip3 install --user matplotlib
pip3 install --user pyqt5
```

Note: sometimes "sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler" will install Protobuf 3+ versions for you and some users have issues when using 3.5. If that is your case, try the manual installation.


#### 2. Download TensorFlow Object Detection API repository from GitHub
Create a folder directly in C: and name it “tensorflow1”. This working directory will contain the full TensorFlow object detection framework, as well as your training images, training data, trained classifier, configuration files, and everything else needed for the object detection classifier.

Download the full TensorFlow object detection repository located at https://github.com/tensorflow/models by clicking the “Clone or Download” button and downloading the zip file. Open the downloaded zip file and extract the “models-master” folder directly into the C:\tensorflow1 directory you just created. Rename “models-master” to just “models”.
(Note, this tutorial was done using this [GitHub commit](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/079d67d9a0b3407e8d074a200780f3835413ef99) of the TensorFlow Object Detection API. If portions of this tutorial do not work, it may be necessary to download and use this exact commit rather than the most up-to-date version.)


#### 3. Set up new Anaconda virtual environment
Next, we'll work on setting up a virtual environment in Anaconda for tensorflow-gpu. From the Start menu in Windows, search for the Anaconda Prompt utility, right click on it, and click “Run as Administrator”. If Windows asks you if you would like to allow it to make changes to your computer, click Yes.

In the command terminal that pops up, create a new virtual environment called “tensorflow1” by issuing the following command:
```
C:\> conda create -n tensorflow1 pip python=3.5
```
Then, activate the environment by issuing:
```
C:\> activate tensorflow1

#### 2e. Configure PYTHONPATH environment variable
A PYTHONPATH variable must be created that points to the \models, \models\research, and \models\research\slim directories. Do this by issuing the following commands (from any directory):
```
(tensorflow1) C:\> set PYTHONPATH=C:\tensorflow1\models;C:\tensorflow1\models\research;C:\tensorflow1\models\research\slim
```
(Note: Every time the "tensorflow1" virtual environment is exited, the PYTHONPATH variable is reset and needs to be set up again.)

#### 2f. Compile Protobufs and run setup.py
Next, compile the Protobuf files, which are used by TensorFlow to configure model and training parameters. Unfortunately, the short protoc compilation command posted on TensorFlow’s Object Detection API [installation page](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) does not work on Windows. Every  .proto file in the \object_detection\protos directory must be called out individually by the command.

In the Anaconda Command Prompt, change directories to the \models\research directory and copy and paste the following command into the command line and press Enter:
```
protoc --python_out=. .\object_detection\protos\anchor_generator.proto .\object_detection\protos\argmax_matcher.proto .\object_detection\protos\bipartite_matcher.proto .\object_detection\protos\box_coder.proto .\object_detection\protos\box_predictor.proto .\object_detection\protos\eval.proto .\object_detection\protos\faster_rcnn.proto .\object_detection\protos\faster_rcnn_box_coder.proto .\object_detection\protos\grid_anchor_generator.proto .\object_detection\protos\hyperparams.proto .\object_detection\protos\image_resizer.proto .\object_detection\protos\input_reader.proto .\object_detection\protos\losses.proto .\object_detection\protos\matcher.proto .\object_detection\protos\mean_stddev_box_coder.proto .\object_detection\protos\model.proto .\object_detection\protos\optimizer.proto .\object_detection\protos\pipeline.proto .\object_detection\protos\post_processing.proto .\object_detection\protos\preprocessor.proto .\object_detection\protos\region_similarity_calculator.proto .\object_detection\protos\square_box_coder.proto .\object_detection\protos\ssd.proto .\object_detection\protos\ssd_anchor_generator.proto .\object_detection\protos\string_int_label_map.proto .\object_detection\protos\train.proto .\object_detection\protos\keypoint_box_coder.proto .\object_detection\protos\multiscale_anchor_generator.proto .\object_detection\protos\graph_rewriter.proto
```
This creates a name_pb2.py file from every name.proto file in the \object_detection\protos folder.

**(Note: TensorFlow occassionally adds new .proto files to the \protos folder. If you get an error saying ImportError: cannot import name 'something_something_pb2' , you may need to update the protoc command to include the new .proto files.)**

Finally, run the following commands from the C:\tensorflow1\models\research directory:
```
(tensorflow1) C:\tensorflow1\models\research> python setup.py build
(tensorflow1) C:\tensorflow1\models\research> python setup.py install
```

Run the following command
```
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
```


Now the download the give source code in the different directory and unzip it.

RUN the following commands from your terminal
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim
```

Enter enter into "object_detection" folder and again run the given commands

```
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim
```

If you successfully install and configure all the system start the application with using terminal

```
python3 main_ui.py
```
